## Inspiration

Following the idea of the youtube video of [Web Dev Junkie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCxb0oTKTg4).

This project is a fullstack MERN application, that allows user to connect via their google account (using oauth2), to a react frontend to send their files that will be store in a s3 bucket, using mongodb as the database to keep track to which file belong to who.

## Technologies used in this project

- Mongo (running on a docker container)
- React
- Express

## Personal 
I'm a fullstack dev but it's been years since I used the majority of this stack (day to day I use nextjs and some python backend). 
I think React is the only think I use regularly. It will be an interesting challenge to implement this solution.
To make it a little bit more challenging I will try to add user authorization to this project.
